#Nested lists are lists which contain lists.
#For examples, X = list(5,7.5,"hello", y = (2.5,10,"goodbye",NA))
#Here list y is nested within list X.

#b.

#gh_repos

#The data is unstructured and hard to work with.
#There appear to be a number of lists within the 6 lists that make up gh_repos.

#c.
repos <- tibble(repo = gh_repos)
repos

#This code is showing me a tibble of the larger list which contains the 6 nested sub lists. This tibble shows that there are 6 lists, 5 of which have 30 elements, 1 with 26 elements.

#d.

#listviewer::jsonedit(gh_repos)

#The data is represented in a interactive display. The data is an array of 6 lists, each corresponding to a github user, each containing a number of lists representing repos. The nested list configuration is in place to better sort the data between users. The list within users setup is used to seperate and identify individual repos. 30 represents the number of repo lists in 5 of the 6 user lists. 68 represents the number of elements within each repo list the user list has.
